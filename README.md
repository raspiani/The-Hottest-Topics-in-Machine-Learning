# The-Hottest-Topics-in-Machine-Learning
Project The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning

Project Description
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, you will analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

Familiarity with Python and pandas is required to complete this Project, as well as experience with Natural Language Processing in Python (sklearn specifically). Check out DataCamp's pandas Foundations, Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, and Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python courses to get familiar or brush up on your skills.

Project Tasks
1. Loading the NIPS papers
2. Preparing the data for analysis
3. Plotting how machine learning has evolved over time
4. Preprocessing the text data
5. A word cloud to visualize the preprocessed text data
6. Prepare the text for LDA analysis
7. Analysing trends with LDA
8. The future of machine learning
